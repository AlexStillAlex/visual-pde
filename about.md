VisualPDE

This site is under construction!

VisualPDE is a website and collection of tools designed to bring the world of partial differential equations to a wider audience through the use of real-time interactive web-based simulations usable on almost any device. We provide numerous examples of such simulations exploring a wide variety of topics from waves and transport theory, to chaotic nonlinear physical systems and pattern-forming models in mathematical biology. A good place to start are the examples of [basic PDEs](/basic-pdes). Beyond specific examples, we hope to encourage advanced users to design their own examples, and share all of our website and simulation code freely under an [MIT License](https://github.com/Pecnut/visual-pde/blob/main/LICENSE.md). Anyone can design their own model simulations, and share these with a URL, or copy the Markdown-based website design hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/Pecnut/visual-pde) to design their own website for use in teaching or research communication etc.

The ideas for this website originated in a [Durham Centre for Academic Development](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/centres/academic-development/) Collaborative Innovation Grant titled *Accessible interactive visualisations in mathematical biology,* which supported Alex Chudasama (a summer student at Durham) to design an early version of an interactive PDE solver based on [this Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion simulator](https://pmneila.github.io/jsexp/grayscott/). The current website and tools are written and maintained by [Benjamin Walker](https://benjaminwalker.info/), [Adam Townsend](https://adamtownsend.com/), and [Andrew Krause](https://www.andrewkrause.org/).
