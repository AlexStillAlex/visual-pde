extract: What is VisualPDE, where did it come from and who is behind it?
---

VisualPDE is a website designed to bring the world of partial differential equations (PDEs) to a wider audience through the use of real-time interactive web-based simulations, usable on almost any device.

This heart-shaped pattern isn't a video. It's a simulation of a PDE system running live on your device<noscript>, or it would be if JavaScript was enabled</noscript>. We provide numerous example simulations on the site, exploring a wide variety of topics from waves and transport theory, to chaotic nonlinear physical systems and pattern-forming models in mathematical biology. VisualPDE simulations can also be found in recent scientific works (see below), allowing you to instantly reproduce cutting-edge findings live on your device.

## People using VisualPDE
Tens of thousands of simulations have been performed using VisualPDE. External applications of VisualPDE include:

* [Visualising landslides](https://imibath.ac.uk/news/landslide-early-warning-system/) using real topographical data from Brazil, with the Institute for Mathematical Innovation, University of Bath

* Providing figures and supporting simulations for a rigorous [study of localised pattern formation in dryalnd vegetation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02956)

* Numerical simulation of temporal and spatiotemporal oscillations in a [model of viral cancer therapy](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.19.572433)

* A [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-023-01250-4) demonstrating the insufficiency of linear stability theory in understanding Turing patterns

## Using VisualPDE
Our collections of [Visual Stories](/visual-stories) and [Introductory PDEs](/basic-pdes) are a good place to start exploring, after which you can delve into the other collections found on the home page. You can also check out our detailed [User guide](/user-guide) and the dedicated [Quick start guide](/user-guide/quick-start).

Beyond our curated examples, we hope to encourage advanced users to design their own simulations. Anyone can design their own model simulations and share them with a URL, or copy the markdown-based website from [GitHub](https://github.com/Pecnut/visual-pde) to design their own website for use in teaching or research communication (see our [licence](https://github.com/Pecnut/visual-pde/blob/main/LICENSE.md) if you're looking for industrial use).

## Origins and contributors
The ideas for this website originated in a [Durham Centre for Academic Development](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/centres/academic-development/) collaborative innovation grant titled *Accessible interactive visualisations in mathematical biology*, which supported Alex Chudasama (a final-year undergraduate at Durham University) to design an early version of an interactive PDE solver based on this [Gray–Scott reaction–diffusion simulator](https://pmneila.github.io/jsexp/grayscott/). 

The current website and tools are written and maintained by [Benjamin Walker](https://benjaminwalker.info/), [Adam Townsend](https://adamtownsend.com/) and [Andrew Krause](https://www.andrewkrause.org/). A detailed article about the context, design, and applications of VisualPDE can be found in the [Bulletin of Mathematical Biology](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-023-01218-4).
