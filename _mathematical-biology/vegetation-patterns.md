Here we look at a model of vegetation patterning known as the [Klasumeier model](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.284.5421.1826).

This is a brief example of messy boundary conditions and spatial heterogeneity inducing complex dynamical behaviours. We consider a heterogeneous version of the [Giererâ€“Meinhardt](/mathematical-biology/gierer-meinhardt) model:

$$\begin{aligned}\pd{w}{t} &= a-w -wn^2+v\pd{w}{x} + \nabla^2w,\\ \pd{n}{t} &= wn^2 - mn + \nabla^2n\end{aligned}$$
