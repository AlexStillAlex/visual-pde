This is a collection of topics on numerical methods/analysis relevant to solving PDEs numerically. These are particularly tailored for how VisualPDE works `under the hood,' which is described in more detail in the [solver documentation](user-guide/quick-start) and the [advanced documentation](user-guide/advanced-options).
